# Rubicon 4
Your friendly, nuts Discord bot, and ingame companion.


## Information
Rubicon 4.x is designed to be cleaner, faster, better in most aspects than Rubicon 3.x.<br>
It is also designed to be much more configurable, with emphasis on real-time configuration updates.<br>
Rubicon also has a vast amount of new features and tweaks, to make it the *best* rubicon.<br>

### What are these new features?
A few include:
- Changing status
- Aforementioned configuration system
- Better, cleaner functionalized code
- A network of files that work together
- More commands, with more options. Rubicon will even do your math!
- Modularity: Add a source file, interface with a brand new entire __API__ to allow Rubicon to use your custom ability!!

### Do you have any ideas for other features?
Yes, here are some that would be awesome, but ambitious and low-priority:
- Cutting out the 3rd party and allowing the model to be ran locally
- Steam accounts and support
- Rubicon self-configuration (Not too ambitious, but still questionable when Rubicon can't get function calls right)
- Outsourcing to other models

### How do I install it?
For the packages, you can use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.<br>
However, Rubicon does use external services - These will require keys and tokens.<br>

To enter your tokens, go to `tokens.json` in the root directory. Enter the names of the environment variables containing your tokens into each field.<br>
Note, however, that if you aren't using Rubicon as a Discord bot, you won't need a Discord bot token.<br>
(Note 2: Rubicon may gain support for being ran locally in the future. In that case, you do not need ANY tokens.)
